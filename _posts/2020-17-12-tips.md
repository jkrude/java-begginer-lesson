## Exercise
## Painting christmas trees
Try to paint a christmas tree using for-loops. The output should look like this:
```
    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
    #
```

You can also decorate it if you want.
```
    *
   ***
  *o***
 ****o**
**o****o*
    #
```

### Bonus: Make it dynamic
Try to write a function `printTree(h)` that prints a tree with a given parameter height h.
