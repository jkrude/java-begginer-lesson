## Slides
- [Here](https://github.com/jkrude/java-begginer-lesson/blob/master/slides/10-lambda.pdf) you can find the slides for the lesson.


#### Why ?
- Reduce boilerplate code
- Higher level functions: functions with functions as parameter
- write super sexy code

#### How ?
- `() -> System.println.out("Hello World")`
    - () : list of parameter, could be (x) or (x,y) for two, types are optional (int x, int y)
    - -> : Separates methods signature and body
    - `System.println.out("Hello World")` : Your method body
        - could have {} in order to support multiple statements
- `(int x) -> x * x` would *return* the square for x
    - `System.println.out("Hello World")` returns `void`
- **FunctionalInterfaces** (interfaces with only one method) can be replaced by lambdas
    ```java
    //  Function is a FunctionalInterface
    public void higherFunction(Function<Integer,Integer> function){...}
  
    // Instead of writing a whole class-implementation we use a lambda (for the parameter function).
    public void someFunction(){
      higherFunction((x) -> x* x);  
    }   
    ```

##### Additional information
- [Article](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-lambda-expressions) with many examples.
- To fully embrace the glory of streams and lambdas have a look at [method-references](https://www.baeldung.com/java-method-references).
- GUI-applications use lambdas quite a lot (for example to bind a method to a button-press).
  
  
## Exercise
- We want to sort some lists and use streams.
- What to do is described within the [methods](https://github.com/jkrude/java-beginner-lesson/blob/master/src/lesson10/Excercise/Exercise.java).
- There are test methods which you can test your approaches.
- You will need [Person](https://github.com/jkrude/java-beginner-lesson/blob/master/src/lesson3and4/Person.java) from lesson3.
    - Just be sure to use the latest master-version or make the class as well as all methods public
    - Have a look [here](https://jkrude.github.io/java-beginner-lesson/git.html) if you forgot how to interact with git.
