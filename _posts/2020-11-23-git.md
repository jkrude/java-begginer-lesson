## What is Git?

- Git is broadly used as The version-control-tool
- The main focus is  a clean traceable history of a file / project
- Image changing a  core mechanic, but after two weeks you realise that it should be undone?
- Imagine you work with multiple people on one project and want to synchronise your progress while managing potential conflicts?
- [Github](https://github.com/) is used to host git-traced projects (however you could use bitbucked usw. too)
- You should learn about git as soon as possible!



## Basics

- A project that is traced by git is called a **repository**
  
- Everything happens in a **branch**
  
  - You can understand it as the context for the current changes
  
- **Commits** are stepping-stones in development
- they documents points which can be revisited, undone etc.
  - Imagine your commits as a chain of checkpoints / savepoints

- There is a *local* and a *remote* version of your project (your branches)
  
  - You can synchronise both states with **pull** / **fetch** and **push**
  



#### Working with the course-materials

- As you may have noticed the course-materials are tracked by git

- In the start you *cloned* our project (and therefore created a local copy)

- We will update / change the *remote* version with every lesson

- You can change your local version, but are not allowed to push any of your changes (because you don't own the repository)

- You can sync your local version with the remote version with `git pull origin master` or by pressing the blue button next to *Git:*

- If you want to play around with your local version we recommend to do this in a separate *branch*

  - This way your master branch has no conflicts with any of our new version

  - You can learn about branches [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell)

  - If you have changes in the master branch but are ok with discarding them you can rollback your branch

    > In IntelliJ: Right-click on any of your project files → Git → Rollback

## Git and IntelliJ

- you can use everything git offers from the command line
- however having a GUI is always handy especially if it comes within your IDE

#### Understanding the colors

| Color | Meaning  |
| ----- | -------- |
| Green | Addition |
| Blue  | Change   |
| Red   | Deletion |
