## Slides
- [Here](https://github.com/jkrude/java-begginer-lesson/blob/master/slides/09-testing.pdf) you can find the slides for the lesson.


#### Why ?
- If you progress further into developing bigger and bigger projects time will come where you cant be certain anything anywhere really works the way it should.
- By **testing your code** from the beginning you can **ensure** (to a certain level) the **correctness**.
- Everyone makes mistakes, making tests is necessary!
- Nobody will use / buy your code if you can't assure that it works.
- Often times testing your code will improve your design.

#### How ?
- There are a lot of great frameworks and tools for testing your code.
- The most common and fundamental is **unit testing**.
    1. Test each class independently.
    2. What functionality offers the class.
    3. Think about test cases for each *public* functionality.
    4. Write a test-method for every test case.
- In most cases only the public *interface* of a class should be tested.
- Using Java **JUnit** is *the* unit testing framework.
- Using **JUnit** in your project is super simple. A description can be found in the slides.
- It is best to have someone else test your code, who didn't work on it before.
- You can run your tests before every commit / push / etc. to make sure that no change has led to an error.

###### Additional information
> If you wonder: Maven is a tool to handle more complex projects with multiple external dependencies.

  - A great [article](https://dev.to/chrisvasqm/introduction-to-unit-testing-with-java-2544) about unit tests.
  - The current version is [JUnit5](https://www.baeldung.com/junit-5)
  - [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) is a great framework if you deal with *dependency-injections* and/or *stubs*.
  
## Exercise
 - Remember [Gnirts](https://github.com/jkrude/java-beginner-lesson/blob/master/src/lesson5/solution/Gnirts.java) from lesson5?
 - We never really tested if it worked!
 - Better we write some unit tests.
 - You can find the template [here](https://github.com/jkrude/java-beginner-lesson/blob/master/src/lesson9/exercise/GnirtsTest.java)
    - Have a look [here](https://jkrude.github.io/java-beginner-lesson/git.html) if you forgot how to interact with git.
