### Why
- You can write Android apps in native Java
- You can test and run your apps on your own device
- You can upload and share your apps via the PlayStore with little to no barrier
- Great [documentation](https://developer.android.com/docs/) from google
- Really easy to use → rapid development
- market share is about ~85%

### How
- File → New → Project → Android (left tab)
    - alternatively with [Android-Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- You will have to download the **Android-SDK**
    - Additionally, you may want to download a simulation-device
    - You can do both in the setup-wizard
- The graphics and logic is strongly separated
#### Project-Structure
- your app should follow the predefined project-structure
    - in app/src/main/java is you implementation logic
    - in app/src/main/res are all your resources
    - in main/res/layout are your main views / activities
    - colors / static strings etc are within main/res/values
#### The GUI
- You can design your interface with the graphical interface or write direct xml-code
- Edit your files (like `activity_main.xml`) in order to define the look of your app
    - Constraint-Layout is the default layout
    - Every element within is defined by 4 constraints in relation to each other
        - Press and hold on one of the circles at the edge of an element
    - Add an element from *Palette* on the left and drag it within the activity 
        - Specify the details in the right tab *Attributes*
        - The most important attribute is the **id** (right on top)
            - It is used for connecting GUI-element and code-object
#### The Logic
- The logic for your application is within normal java-classes
- Instead of defining the main method you extend the `AppCompatActivity` class
    - You should override the `onCreate` method
    - Read about the lifecycle (`onStart`, `onCreate` etc.) [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle)
- Define all elements (`TextView`, `Button`, etc.) you want to use as class attributes
    - Each GUI-element can be represented as Java-Object
    - For example a Button (GUI) could be used as`Button button;`
- within `onCreate` initialize the attributes by gluing it to a GUI-element
    - `button = findViewById(R.id.buttonElement);`
    - `buttonElement` is the ID you gave the GUI-Element
    - once inflated your objects are safe to use for the rest of runtime
- Retrieve information or change an element use normal getter and setter
    - For example `button.setText("Click me")` will set the label of you button

#### Additional information
- There are many great resources for learning *Android*

- Don't be intimidated by the complexity on first sight
    - Start small and tackle each topic one by one
